#### Longevity
NARS's formula tends to last longer than most drugstore options

#### Comfort
Some long-wearing dupes sacrifice comfort for longevity

#### Color Accuracy
While many get close, slight variations in undertone (more pink, orange, or plum) are common

#### Application
The unique NARS applicator provides precise application that bullet lipsticks may not match
